# First Project in Unity
 
 This project was a lot of fun. 
 The goals I had going into this project were:
   - Making a convincing wandering enemy.
   - Having distinct enemy aggro and wndering phases.
   - Enemy pathfinding
   - Enemy attacking
   
 Post-Morden
   - I got everything but attacking! 
   - I leanred about the Unity Engine.
